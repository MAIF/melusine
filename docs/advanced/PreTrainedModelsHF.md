# Use pre-trained models from HuggingFace in the Melusine framework


> The Hugging Face library has become an invaluable resource in the data science field, offering easy-to-use models that excel across a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

# How to leverage these models within the Melusine framework to build:

* A powerful processor using model embeddings.
* An intelligent detector utilizing fine-tuned model layers.

Transformers-based models from Hugging Face can significantly enhance detection capabilities and act as a complementary approach to strengthen prediction results.

## How to Choose and Use Models

The selection of a model depends on the specific detection task. For example:

    **Sentiment detection in French text/emails:** 
    Suitable models include: camembert-base, distil-camembert-base, or distil-camembert-base.
    These models can be seamlessly integrated into your workflow to enhance predictions and optimize detection outcomes.
