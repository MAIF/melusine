## Overview


Melusine is a high-level library for emails processing that can be used to :

- Categorize emails using AI, regex patterns or both
- Prioritize urgent emails
- Extract information
- And much more !

## Why melusine ?

The added value of melusine mainly resides in the following aspects:

- **Off-the-shelf features** :  melusine comes with a number of features that can be used straightaway
    - Segmenting messages in an email conversation
    - Tagging message parts (Email body, signatures, footers, etc)
    - Transferred email handling
- **Execution framework** : users can focus on the email qualification code and save time on the boilerplate code  
    - debug mode  
    - pipeline execution  
    - code parallelization
    - etc
- **Integrations** : the modular nature of melusine makes it easy to integrate with a variety of AI frameworks
  (HuggingFace, Pytorch, Tensorflow, etc)
- **Production ready** : melusine builds-up on the feedback from several years of running automatic email processing 
in production at MAIF.

## Use cases

- Email routing: Make sure emails are sent to the most appropriate destination.
- Prioritization: Ensure urgent emails are treated first.
- Summarization: Save time reading summaries instead of long emails.
- Filtering: Remove undesired emails.
